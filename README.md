Is the email you just received just noise? I have a powerful AI tool to help you figure it out and make your day more productive!

This monorepo contains the SPA and API components of the analyzer and, as such, technical details about them can be found inside each folder.

## <span style="color: #f72585">Access and hosting

This project (as usual with my other work) is entirely self-hosted. I built the infrastructure on a personal work server built by myself.
It's running on a headless Arch Linux setup with `Linux 6.14.10`, the process managed by `systemd` and the HTTP access point running inside a `nginx` container.

The logs are tracked with the built-in `journalctl`.

The results can be found at [Email Meaningfulness Analyzer](https://arthurtv.duckdns.org/).

If you need help with this project or to discuss the use of one technology over another, you can email me with:

Since I've not provided in depth explanation on how to deploy this yourself, we can discuss this too.
